            from <i>do platypuses produce milk?</i> to <i>is it normal to want
            to punch something when angry?</i> to <i>how do i know if someone
            likes me?</i> my incognito google chrome window has seen just about
            everything—the heartwarming, the ugly, the crazy. in fact, if you
            take every single one of my searches and piece them together, you
            could probably understand me better than even i do. i guess it’s
            something about seeking refuge in the fact that my feelings are
            common enough to be explained by a WikiHow article in the top 5
            google search results. or that i can’t find the right words to
            describe exactly what i’m feeling or my response to something, but
            instead someone on reddit can tell me that i actually deal with
            <b>revenge bedtime procrastination</b>. or really that sometimes i
            don’t know what to do with myself and with what i’m thinking so i
            pour my thoughts into the google search bar just to get a reaction
            (from who? from what? i don’t know). at this point, the Cmd + Shift
            + N is almost a reflex—i feel overwhelmed with emotion and i just
            start googling away. <br><br>
            i’ve always placed a lot of value in being unique, in being
            <i>different</i> than everyone else. i mean, in eighth grade my
            friend sent me this <a href = "https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/"
            target="_blank">special kind of personality test</a> that was
            supposed to be more encompassing than <a href =
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator"
            target = "_blank">MBTI</a>, and i got “the individualist.” when i
            heard that she got the same thing, as ironic as it is, i retook the
            quiz with different answers so that i could get a different
            classification. or when i ran my first half marathon, i actively
            asked no one to show up at the finish line because that was a
            feeling i wanted to experience completely on my own. and when
            Spotify Wrapped inevitably tells me that my top genre is pop, i’m
            always so embarrassed to admit it.<br><br>
            earlier this summer when someone told me about how they felt this
            exact desire to be unique, i got so excited because i felt so
            <i>heard</i>. i always say that when i do my longest runs, there’s
            always a point where the trail feels so empty, when there is no one
            else i can see—and those moments feel the loneliest. there are
            very few times i’ve felt the same satisfaction as i did when i heard
            that Hank Green <a href =
            "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BOLDm5tWuo&ab_channel=vlogbrothers"
            target = "_blank">had the same favorite movie as i do</a> (<i>Puss
            in Boots: The Last Wish</i>—i think “perfect” is the only way to
            describe it). so how is it possible that the same person who didn’t
            want to share a personality classification with anyone else, who
            wanted to cross the finish line alone, who doesn’t want to share her
            media taste with others, could also simultaneously feel all of these
            other things? could i, who endlessly made fun of harvard’s “it’s
            lonely at the top” sweatshirts, be striving for that exact
            feeling?<br><br>
            i’m not really sure. maybe it <i>is</i> possible to feel both. when i
            indulge in voluntarily feeling things within my own bubble, i
            immediately turn to google to hide the fact that i also seek solace.
            and in the process, i forget that as much as i want to be an
            individualist and carve out my own path, it’s okay to step back and
            find comfort in that i’m not alone in this fact. i’m not unique in
            wanting to be unique. but nonetheless, we each are filled with our
            own thoughts—our own set of google searches that no two people can
            share. so somehow, all the ways in which i am different from
            everyone around me also make me that much similar to them.<br><br>
            sometimes i wish i could see what other people’s google searches
            would be. i want to know what my favorite Caltrain conductor thinks
            about on a random afternoon, or why that person who forgot their
            starbucks on the WeWork counter decided to put 5 shots of espresso
            in their coffee that day. i’d like to think that if you could
            randomly sample a person, and got to read all of what would comprise
            their google searches, it would be hard <i>not</i> to fall in love with
            them. Fredrick Backman puts it perfectly in <i>Anxious People</i>—“it’s
            always very easy to declare that other people are idiots, but only
            if you forget how idiotically difficult being human is.” and a lot
            of the time, i do forget. i forget with the person i just booed at
            while driving, i forget with the person i just judged for ordering
            DoorDash from a place just 5 minutes away, i forget with myself.
            until i hit Cmd + Shift + N and find out that pandalover623 on
            Quora, 12 years ago, asked the same question as me.
